 * Destination Absolute Path or "Mount Relative Path" is a cumbersome name to
 * describe a path that looks like it's absolute but the root of the path is the
 * source or dest directory. For context think about cloning a drive we mount
 * the drives root to '/media/drive' and we copy to '/media/drive2' the
 * destination absolute path (aka DAPath) is '/file' where we can append the
 * source or destination mount points to the beginning and get the full path.
